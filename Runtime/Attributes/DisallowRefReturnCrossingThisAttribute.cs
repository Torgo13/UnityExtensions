    ///     with
    ///     calls to methods that also have this attribute.
    ///     Motivation(s): ref returns of values that are backed by native memory (unsafe), like IComponentData in ecs chunks,
    ///     can have the referenced
    ///     memory invalidated by certain methods. A way is needed to detect these situations a compilation time to prevent
    ///     accessing invalidated references.
    ///     Notes:
    ///     - This attribute is used/feeds a Static Analyzer at compilation time.
    ///     - Attribute transfers with aggragations: struct A has this attribute, struct B has a field of type A; both A and B
    ///     are concidered to have the attribute.
    /// </summary>
